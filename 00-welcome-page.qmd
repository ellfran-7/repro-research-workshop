To ensure everything runs smoothly on the day of the workshop, we’ll need to set up a few things beforehand.


## Brief Workshop Overview

The workshop will be divided into two parts:

1.  Reproducible Research: An Open Discussion
2.  Literate Programming with Quarto: A Small but Impactful Step

**Part 1** will be discussion-based, focusing on the concept of reproducibility, its importance, and the factors contributing to non-reproducibility. There will be practical work also. No prior coding or bioinformatics knowledge is needed here.

**Part 2** is hands-on and involves practical work using specific informatic tools. To participate fully, you’ll need to download or update these tools in advance. Don’t worry—they’re free and easy to set up! Let's go!
