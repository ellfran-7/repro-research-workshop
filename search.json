There will be practical work also. No prior coding or bioinformatics knowledge is needed here.\nPart 2 is hands-on and involves practical work using specific informatic tools.

    "text": "3 Software requirements\nThe majority of the practical aspect of the workshop involves a computer, and therefor using specific tools. If you intend on participating fully, you‚Äôll need to download (or update) these tools in advance. Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre free and easy to set up! Let‚Äôs go!\n\n\n3.1 The scientific and technical publishing system: Quarto\nQuarto is an open-source system for scientific and technical publishing, built on Pandoc1. It allows you to create reproducible documents by integrating code, results, and narrative. Outputs can include HTML, PDF, Word, and more.\nTo use Quarto, you‚Äôll need to install the Quarto CLI, which handles rendering Quarto documents. Download the latest version from the Quarto website and follow the installation instructions.\n\n\n\n3.2 The programming language: R\nR is a powerful programming language for data science. You can download it for free from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). At the top of the CRAN homepage, you‚Äôll find links for different operating systems: Windows, Mac, or Linux.\nIf you‚Äôre having trouble in orientating the sites, don‚Äôt worry! Below I provide detailed instructions for each operating system:\n\n\nDownload for Windows\n\nTo install R on Windows, click the ‚ÄúDownload R for Windows‚Äù link. Then click the ‚Äúbase‚Äù link. Next, click the first link at the top of the new page. This link should say something like ‚ÄúDownload R-4.4.2 for Windows‚Äù, except the 4.4.2 will be replaced by the most current version of R. The link downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows. Run this program and step through the installation wizard that appears. The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that you‚Äôll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n\n\n\nDownload for MacOS\n\nTo install R on a Mac, click the ‚ÄúDownload R for Mac‚Äù link. Next, click on the R-4.4.2 package link (or the package link for the most current release of R). An installer will download to guide you through the installation process, which is very easy. The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users. I‚Äôve never found a reason to change them. If your computer requires a password before installing new progams, you‚Äôll need it here.\n\n\n\nDownload for Linux\n\nR comes preinstalled on many Linux systems, but you‚Äôll want the newest version of R if yours is out of date. The CRAN website provides files to build R from source on Debian, Redhat, SUSE, and Ubuntu systems under the link ‚ÄúDownload R for Linux.‚Äù Click the link and then follow the directory trail to the version of Linux you wish to install on. The exact installation procedure will vary depending on the Linux system you use. CRAN guides the process by grouping each set of source files with documentation or README files that explain how to install on your system.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 The IDE2: Rstudio\nRStudio is an application like Microsoft Word‚Äîexcept that instead of helping you write in English or French, RStudio helps you write in R.\nYou can download RStudio for free. Just click the ‚ÄúDownload RStudio Desktop For [Your OS]‚Äù button and follow the installation steps. Once installed, open RStudio like any other application‚Äîusually by clicking its desktop icon.\nWhen you open RStudio, you‚Äôll see a window with three panes, as shown below: (Figure¬†1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: The Rstudio IDE for R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 The toolset: R packages\nR packages are collections of functions, data, and documentation that expand R‚Äôs capabilities. To work with Quarto in R, ensure the following packages are installed:\n\nggplot2\nquarto\nknitr\nrmarkdown\n\nTo check and install these packages, run the following code in RStudio (in the console pane, shown on the left of Figure¬†1):\n\npackages &lt;- c(\"ggplot2\", \"quarto\", \"knitr\", \"rmarkdown\")\ninstalled &lt;- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())\n\nif (any(!installed)) {\n  message(\"Missing some packages...\")\n  install.packages(packages[!installed])\n} else {\n  message(\"Everything is good to go!\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Finish line\nIf you encounter any issues with downloads or installations, feel free to email me at ellis.franklin@univ-lorraine.fr or visit me directly at the Metz site in the P7 building, office M3.\nIf you‚Äôve successfully set everything up, you‚Äôre ready for the workshop! Congratulations! üéâ\nSee you on the 6th of Feb! üêß\n\n(back to top)"
